# ChatBot1.0-PYTHON-Practice1
In this repository, 
I am trying to learn how to create a chatbot. In making a chatbot, of course, it is important for the chatbot to know and be able to reply to the things we want.
My goals is to create a chatbot that can help us order food.
In the progress it's still a Chatbot 1.0, which is still a very simple build. Later it is hoped that this chatbot can work automation.
